# ml_randomforest_image
Use random forest regression to approximate an image by learning a function, f : R^2â†’R, that takes the (x , y) coordinates of an image as input and outputs pixel brightness. The code consists of pre-processing the input and output, and experimentation with random forest and k-nearest neighbor.
